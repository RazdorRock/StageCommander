# Stage Commander

Purpose of this project is to develop an open, cross platform solution to control scene actions on a stage, show, event; including DMX controlled stage scenography equipment (lights, scanners, lasers, fog machines, flame throwers :)...) and to have fun with it.
Main idea was to give a chance to the audience to be directly involved in a show performance. By having a control (limited or unlimited) over a scenography features in order to bring up the interaction between performer and audience to the next level.
