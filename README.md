# Stage Commander

Purpose of this project is to develop a open cross platform solution to control scene actions on a stage, show, event, including DMX controlled stage scenography equipment (lights, scanners, lasers, fog machines, flame throwers :)...) and to have fun with it.
Main idea was to give a chance to the audience to be involved in a show performance on a next level, by having a control (limited or unlimited) over a scenography and bring up the interaction between performer and audience.
